Meeting with Andrew and Scott : September 2, 2016

Purpose of LaunchBot:

Run the container, but save changes to content in files to a local working directory in order to later commit to github. In order for the connection to be made, must have the following 3 parameters at end of Dockerfile. The one sets the working directory - you should launch launchbot on the directory where the files are that you want to be using in the container (e.g. the notebook). The port says which port you will be working on and the last line starts the services you will be needing in the container.

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/workdir

# Expose the notebook port
EXPOSE 8888

# Start the notebook server
CMD jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8888 --ip=*
